This letter proposes a new 4D autonomous chaotic system characterized by the abundant coexisting attractors 
and a simple mathematical description. The new system which is constructed from the Sprott B
system is dissipative, symmetric, chaotic and has two unstable equilibria. For a given set of parameters,
butterfly attractors are emerged from the system. These butterfly attractors will be broken into a pair
of symmetric strange attractors with the variation of the parameters. A variety of coexisting attractors
are spotted in the system including six periodic attractors, four periodic attractors with two chaotic attractors, 
two periodic attractors with three chaotic attractors, two periodic attractors with two chaotic
attractors, four periodic attractors, etc. Finally, the system is established via an electronic circuit which
can physically confirm the complex dynamics of the system.
